            <div class="summary">Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and 
                collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of 
                agent drift—the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences.We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for....<a class="read" >read more.</a></div>
